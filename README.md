# Banking App Project

Welcome to my Banking App project! This web application simulates a basic banking system, allowing users to log in, view their account balance, make transfers, request loans, and even close their accounts. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it serves as a practical implementation of front-end development concepts.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can log in securely using their unique usernames and PINs.
- **Account Operations:** Perform various banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and loan requests.
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** The interface dynamically updates to display account movements, balance, and a summary of transactions.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work seamlessly on various devices, providing a consistent user experience.

## How to Use

1. Enter your username and PIN to log in.
2. Explore the dashboard to view your account details and make transactions.
3. Use the transfer feature to send money to other accounts securely.
4. Request a loan if needed, based on your account's transaction history.
5. Close your account if you wish to terminate your banking relationship.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The JavaScript logic handles user interactions, updates the UI dynamically, and manages banking functionalities.
